# Student-Life-Portal

This project was the final project as part of our Database Systems course at LAU.
It was developed using the XAMPP stack along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and 
serves as a centralized platform for students to access and book various services provided by our university
whilst offering a user-friendly interface where students can navigate through different service options and 
make bookings as per their preferences.
